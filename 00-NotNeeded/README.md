![Advanced C#: Language Features][lil-thumbnail-url] 

In this advanced C# course, instructor Joe Marini dives deep into language features. Joe goes over language constructs such as indexes and ranges, literal number improvements, the null-coalescing operator, and two uses for deconstruction syntax. He gives you an overview of pattern matching, then shows you basic patterns, enhanced switch statements, position patterns, and relational patterns. Joe covers object-oriented programming features, including how to work with indexers, override the ToString method of a class, and conduct equality testing. Plus, he walks you through using records to create types that have common default behaviors and immutability.
